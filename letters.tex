\section{Letter of pre-agreement}
\note{for DN-JD, delete otherwise. \\
For DN-JD, letters of pre-agreement must also be included from those academic beneficiaries/associated partners that will award the doctoral degrees, in part B (document 2) of the proposal. These letters should be signed by an authorised legal representative of the organisation in question so as to offer reasonable assurance regarding the commitment to award the joint, double or multiple doctoral degree(s). These letters should also indicate agreement with the principle that the awarding of such degrees is a precondition for funding. A template for these letters is provided below and must be followed by all academic DN-JD applicants awarding the doctoral degree(s)\\.
In case the letter does not follow in full the template or fails to give enough assurance on the commitment in the project (e.g. no signature, wrong proposal references, outdated letterâ€¦), the experts may penalise the proposal on these aspects under the implementation evaluation criterion. Missing letters of pre-agreement will lead to the exclusion of the entity, which may affect the eligibility of the proposal.\\
Letters of pre-agreement must be included in the PDF file (Part B, document 2); these should not be attached in a separate PDF file or as an embedded file since this makes them invisible.\\
The template for the letter of pre-agreement is available on page 26 of the rtf template or 54 of the MSCA-NET Handbook.}
